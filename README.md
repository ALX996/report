Next, let's add an animation.  When the user hovers the mouse over the icon button of the selected language, the button will be highlighted in corporate colors (for example, blue).  And at the moment when the selected language is highlighted in blue, the two buttons of the icons of the other two languages begin to fade (colors of the brand book).

Initially, the user sees three news items.  Further, when you click on the arrow, the following three news items open.  News  preview Forward and backward.  When you move the mouse over the arrow, it is highlighted in corporate blue!  When you hover the mouse over the news, the news is enlarged, when you click on the news, it opens in a new window.  The number of pictures in the news is one. The maximum text is 500 characters.  There should always be a "More" button when needed.  When pressed “More”, nothing happens to it. News must be with the possibility of editing in the future by employees of the company. 
### 4. Under the “My news” block, add the “Company reports” block. In this block, you need to place 4 types of documents.  Iconography is needed for each type of document.  Icons must be in corporate colors and correspond to each type of document.  Add an arrow, as in the picture in Figma, when you click on which the document will be downloaded, the download button is static all the time.
